    <h1>Tonkotsu Ramen Broth</h1>
    <img src="../images/tonkotsubroth.svd">
    <p class="info">Tonkotsu ramen broth is simply pork bones cooked at a rolling boil for 12 hours. The process extracts all the goodness of the pork and turns the broth creamy white.</p>

<h3> Important notes</h3>

<h4>Bones</h4>
<p>You may use the bones of your choice, We will be using pork neck bones for tonkotsu broth. It’s not make or break though. You just want bones with a bit of meat on them. Adds flavour.</p>
 
<h4>Clean bones is the key to a good tonkotsu ramen broth</h4>
<p>There’s a lot of Asian technique here that you don’t see in classic western cooking. Blanching the bones is a big one. Add all the bones to a pot. Bring to a boil. Cook for about 5 minutes. Then dump it all out and rinse the bones.
    The reason for this is to get rid of all that muck floating on the surface of the stock. Muck that would get boiled into the stock. Muck that would likely ruin the broth.</p>
<h4>A rolling boil makes a magical broth</h4>
<p>Something happens when you cook pork bones at a rolling boil. All the gelatin and fat and goodness comes out of the bones and turns the stock that milky white colour.Just make sure you keep adding water to keep the bones submerged.</p> 
<p>Don’t use a slow cooker for this. Won’t work. People have tried. They have failed. </p>
<h4>To cover or not</h4>
<p>You can find videos of Japanese ramen joints making their broth. Huge pots of stock boiling away. They don’t cover their pots. But they have staff in the kitchen full time.</p>
<p>You can try it uncovered if you are planning to hang out in the kitchen all day. Your call.A loosely covered lid keeps some of the evaporation in check.</p>   
<p>You still need to pay attention though. You are maintaining a rolling boil for 12 hours. Covered or not it can boil dry and this will ruin the broth.</p>
